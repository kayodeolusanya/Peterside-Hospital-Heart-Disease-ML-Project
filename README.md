Peterside Hospital is a private hospital located in Lagos,
Nigeria. It was founded in 2000. Peterside Hospital is known for its state-of-the-art facilities,
modern equipment, and highly skilled medical professionals.
The hospital has a team of over 300 medical personnel,
including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals,

The hospital has several specialized clinics, including a
diabetes clinic, a fertility clinic, a heart clinic, and a cancer
clinic. It also offers services such as health check-ups,
laboratory tests, and imaging services.

I have been hired as a Data Scientist to build
a machine-learning model that can predict the
likelihood of a person having a heart disease
based on the given features.
